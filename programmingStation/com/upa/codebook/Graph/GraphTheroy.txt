Graph Theory :

Graph Representation : 
	1) Adjacency Matrix 
	2) Adjacency List 
	3) Edge List 

 
Graph Traversal : 
	   What can we do by simply traversing the graph : 
	   
		1) DFS (Depth First Search )  
			This algorithm uses stack . 
			Time complexity is (V+E).
			
			
		2) BFS (Breadth First Search )
			This algorithm uses queue .
			Time complexity is (V+E).
			We can find the layers using this algorithm . 
			This algorithm can be useful for breadth first search shortest distance or path , 
			it will be a greedy algorithm . But this can be useful for finding shortest 
			distance from a given point to all the points in the graph . 
			
		3) Finding Connected Components in a graph . 
			User dfs , and check wherether all vertices are visited or not , 
			if any vertex is not visited , then again go for dfs from that 
			vertex . In this way we will get all the connected components . 
		4) Flood Fill - Labeling / Coloring the connected components . 
			This algorithm is used to color the components of the graph . 
			Connected components will be colored as same . 
			Now increase the color number for next connected component . 
			For next connected components we will use that increased color code . 
			In this way we will cover all the connected components . 
			We can use dfs to traverse the graph and find the connected components of graph . 
			Implement this algorithm in java from Competitive Programming by steven and Felix .
		5) Topological Sorting 
			1) Make sure that graph is directed acyclic graph 
			2) There can be many answers of topological sorting , means there can be many 
				order sequences of topological sorting for a particular graph .
			3) This algorithm can be useful in many real life applications , like course
				selection system in universities etc . 
			4) One application of topological sorting is to find a possible sequence of modules that a University
				student has to take to fulfill his graduation requirement. Each module has certain pre-requisites
				to be met. This pre-requisites can be modeled as a DAG. Topological sorting this module prerequisites DAG gives the student a linear list of modules to be taken one after another without
				violating the pre-requisites constraint.
			5) This topological sorting is just application of dfs algorithm .

		7) Graph Edges Property Check using DFS Spanning Tree .
		
		8) Finding articulation points and bridges ( in undirected Graph ).
		
		9) Finding Strongly Connected Components in graph .

Minimum Spanning Tree : MST
	1) Kruskal's Algorithm : 
		This algorithm first sorts all the edges in acending order and 
		stores this in edge list data structure . 
		Now , we select the smallest edge and add this is one set , then we 
		select next edge and check whether it creates a cycle or not using 
		light weight union find disjoint set , if not then we connect that edge 
		, this is greedy algorithm . In this way we find the Minimum cost 
		required to reach all the vertices in a graph . 
		Complexity of this algorithm is (E log V). 
			Calculate complexity of this algorithm : 
			1) Sorting the Edges + Adding each edge * checking cycle using union find disjoint set 
			
			Sorting the edges takes (E logE) in edge list data structure . 
			Adding each edge * cycle checking  = E*1
			Total is E log E + E = ElogE (Neglecting E ) . 
			Maximum number of edges will be V^2 . 
			Hence E log E = E log V^2 = 2* ElogV  = E log V. 
	2) Prim's Algorithm : 
		This is simple algorithm which first takes a vertex (Say we want a MST 
		from a particular vertex) . Now , we mark this vertex as visited and 
		store all the adjacent vertices into the priority queue with their weights. 
		Now we select the edge with least value of weight , and connect it to the our vertex . 
		Now , we again add the adjacent vertex of this newly added vertex into the priority 
		queue . This time we select the edge and check whether it creates a cycle or not by just
		checking its flag whether it has been visited before or not . If not then we 
		add that edge . And repeat the process until we add V-1 edges to our mst . Becasue 
		every mst will have V-1 edges to it . 
	3) Applications of this MST 
		1) Maximum Spanning Tree : 
			1) Simple use the krushkal algorithm, in this algorithm , instead 
			of sorting the edge list in increasing order , sort them in decreasing order . 
		2) Partial 'Minimum' Spanning Tree . 
			1) Some of the edges are already fixed and necessary , now we have to find the mst
			assuming that selected edges are necessary . So , first add those edges into 
			our krushkal algorithm and then apply the algorithm for remainng edges . 
		3) Minimum Spanning Forest : 
			1) In this type of problems , we are given the number of 
			components to be connected to create the minimum spanning tree . So , 
			run the krushkal algorithm until we reach to the give number of 
			necessary connected components . 
		4) Second Best Spanning Tree : 
			First create a MST using krushkal algorithm , and just skipp to add v-1 edge from 
			edge list . Select the next minimum weight edge . We will get the second best minimum 
			spanning tree . 
		5) Minimax (and Maximin) (Important ... Implement this ) . 
			Create a minimum spanning tree using kruskal algorithm . Now traverse the 
			spanning tree for the given vertex i and j . Now calculate the cost . This is 
			simple problem in which we have to create minimum spanning tree . After that 
			we have to find the minimum path cost between two vertex i and j . 

Shortest Path : 
	1) Single Source Shortest Path . 		
		Given a graph and we have to find shortest path to the all the 
		vertices of the graph from the given source . There are many 
		efficient algorithms for solving this type of problems . 
		If the graph is un-weighted then we can make one assumption that 
		distance between any two vertices is 1 unit . For this type of un-weighted 
		graph we can use simple and efficient algorithm which is "Breadth First 
		Search " . I has time complexity of (V + E ) . 
		Now , let's suppose the graph is weighted graph . We can use Dijkstra's algorithm 
		for this weighted graph which has complexity of (v+ e log v).  But this Dijkstra's 
		algorithm does not work correctly with the graph having negative edges . So , 
		for that purpose we have bellman ford's algorithm whose complexity is (V*E) . 
	
	2) Single source shortest path on unweighted graph . 
		This is simple variant of BFS algorithm .  
		Possible variants include: BFS on implicit graph (2D grid: UVa 10653 or 3-D grid: UVa 532), BFS with the
		printing of the actual shortest path (UVa 11049), BFS on graph with some blocked vertices (UVa
		10977), BFS from multi-sources (UVa 11101), BFS with single destination – solved by reversing
		the role of source and destination (UVa 11513), BFS with non-trivial states (UVa 321, 10150), etc.
		We can also run BFS from more than one source. We call this variant the
		Multi-Sources Shortest Paths (MSSP) on unweighted graph problem. Try solving UVa 11101 and
		11624 to get the idea of MSSP on unweighted graph. A naive solution is to call BFS multiple times.
		If there are k possible sources, such solution will run inO(k×(V+E)).
		
		
	3) Varients of single source shortest path are 
		1) Single Pair shortest path (SPSP) 
			Both Source and destination are given . 
		2) Single destination shortest path . 
			It is our usual single source shortest path algorithm , we are just changing 
			the source with the destination , remaining implementation is same . 
			Naive approach is to do single source shortest path from a given vertex 
			and then just reverse path because the given source is actually a destination . 
		
	4) Single Source Shortest Path On Weighted Graph . 
		1) Dijkstra's Algorithm on weighted graph is a greedy algorithm used for finding 
		shortest path from a particular source to the all the other remaining sources . 
		This can be implemented easily with priority queue with complexy of (E log v). 
		It can also be implemented using Binary Heap , where we need to use important 
		property of heapDecreaseKey() . This priority queue implementation 
		use the inbuild data structure of java , which makes it easy to implement but this
		allows to add duplicate vertices in the priority queueu . If we try to implement this 
		Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph with negative edge then it may lead to infinite loop .
